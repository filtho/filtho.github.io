###   Hi! Welcome to my collection of fun visualizations

- [This](./dog2d.html) shows an embedding on a adog dataset in 2D. (show this using different mjaomjao.)


- Given an embedding, we [here](./knn_pheno_pred.html) visualize the decision boundaries for a knn-regression model for phenotype prediction. This give an insight on how using more neighbours smoothes the decision boundary. From the results on the [poster](./poster.pdf)
