### Hi! Welcome to my collection of fun visualizations

- [This](./dog2d.html) shows an embedding on a dog dataset in 2D.


- Given an embedding, we [here](./knn_pheno_pred.html) visualize the decision boundaries for a knn-regression model for phenotype prediction. This give an insight on how using more neighbours smoothes the decision boundary. From the results on the [poster](./poster.pdf) we see that the best prediction score is obtained at k=12, a middle-ground between too much smoothing, and too little (which yields overfitting).
